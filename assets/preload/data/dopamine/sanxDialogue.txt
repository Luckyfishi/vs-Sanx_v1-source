:gf:7:nope:Honey, I think we've strayed far from the camping spot Pico said.
:bf:10:nope:Uh, I can understand this map, just give me some time.
:bf:9:nope:The coverage is terrible here, or I would have made a call. Why these guys like to make things complicated?
:gf:8:nope:The sun is going down……
:bf:6:nope:Hey, look ahead. There are some dark buildings.
:gf:7:nope:......? It's just ruins, and...
:gf:7:nope:a very old castle?
:bf:5:nope:It must be Pico's idea. I know it. He likes to play this kind of trick.
:gf:7:nope:"Camping" in a crumbling castle?
:gf:6:nope:Although that doesn't sound like a good idea, it's like something that Pico would do.
:bf:7:nope:Maybe he's been waiting for us for long. Let's hurry.
:gf:6:nope:Hope so.

:gf:2:nope:No, actually we'll leave here right away.
:sanx:4:nope:......
:sanx:4:nope:......Sorry, beautiful lady.
:sanx:4:nope:You don't have the right to come in and leave freely.
:sanx:2:nope:If you want to walk around here, you must have the permission of Sanx -- the owner of this castle, in other words, my permission~
:bf:11:nope:beep……
:bf:6:nope:Well, if you say so, then let's have a battle......
:gf:4:nope:Honey.
:gf:2:nope:Don't forget we are in a hurry.
:bf:5:nope:Ah, this won't take long, my sweet.
